                <h3>Deployment Models</h3>
                <p>We offer various deployment models including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Public Cloud</strong></li>
                    <p>The name says it all. It is accessible to the public. Public deployment models in the cloud are perfect for organizations with growing and fluctuating demands. It also makes a great choice for companies with low-security concerns. Thus, you pay a cloud service provider for networking services, compute virtualization & storage available on the public internet. It is also a great delivery model for teams with development and testing. Its configuration and deployment are quick and easy, making it an ideal choice for test environments.</p>

                    <li><strong>Private Cloud</strong></li>
                    <p>It means that it will be integrated with your data center and managed by your IT team. Alternatively, you can also choose to host it externally. The private cloud offers bigger opportunities that help meet specific organization's requirements when it comes to customization. It's also a wise choice for mission-critical processes that may have frequently changing requirements.</p>

                    <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud</strong></li>
                    <p>As the name suggests, a hybrid cloud is a combination of two or more cloud architectures. While each model in the hybrid cloud functions differently, it is all part of the same architecture. Further, as part of this deployment of the cloud computing model, the internal or external providers can offer resources.</p>

                    <li><strong>Community Cloud</strong></li>
                    <p>The community cloud operates in a way that is similar to the public cloud. There's just one difference - it allows access to only a specific set of users who share common objectives and use cases. This type of deployment model of cloud computing is managed and hosted internally or by a third-party vendor. However, you can also choose a combination of all three.</p>
